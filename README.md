    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

> Return the WebAssembly data type associated with a provided array [data type][@stdlib/array/dtypes] value.

<section class="usage">

## Usage

To use in Observable,

```javascript
dtype2wasm = require( 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/wasm-base-dtype2wasm@umd/browser.js' )
```

To vendor stdlib functionality and avoid installing dependency trees for Node.js, you can use the UMD server build:

```javascript
var dtype2wasm = require( 'path/to/vendor/umd/wasm-base-dtype2wasm/index.js' )
```

To include the bundle in a webpage,

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/wasm-base-dtype2wasm@umd/browser.js"></script>
```

If no recognized module system is present, access bundle contents via the global scope:

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
(function () {
    window.dtype2wasm;
})();
</script>
```

#### dtype2wasm( dtype )

Returns the WebAssembly data type associated with a provided array [data type][@stdlib/array/dtypes] value.

```javascript
var out = dtype2wasm( 'float64' );
// returns 'float64'

out = dtype2wasm( 'int8' );
// returns 'int8'
```

If provided an unknown or unsupported array data type, the function **assumes** that associated values can be stored as double-precision floating-point numbers and returns `'float64'`.

```javascript
var out = dtype2wasm( 'foobar' );
// returns 'float64'
```
